Hello, Assemblymember Reyes, My name is Matthew McGilvery. I am a constituent in your District and I applied for unemployment in March of this year. On June 17th I received my first unemployment payment after being approved for both unemployment and pandemic unemployment assistance. Since that June 17th date I have not received any payment or any communication from the EDD or from any party related to the matter. It has been over a month almost two months since I received just the first unemployment check since then there has been nothing sent to me. I need you to do something about that I've tried to contact the EDD using the where is my payment method for the past month that's not good enough that's not going to suffice. I've called the numbers that the EDD have provided and I've gotten no help. I have gotten the run around. I've contacted the labor secretary of the state and have gotten the run around. So I'm coming to you because I need the money and my life circumstance is getting desperate. I was approved for about $190 a week in unemployment assistance you gave me the first check to qualify for the I mean to quantify the first 2 weeks which was a $334 check that was given on the 17th of June we are now on the 31st of July and I have not received any follow-up payment any follow-up communication on the matter. That is a problem I need you as my state representative to initiate some kind of action with the proper channels on this matter. That's issue number 1, issue number 2 pertains to the PUA assistance program I have not received any follow-up for or payment for that although I was approved for that over a month ago that is also a problem for which I have gone through the proper channels to try to communicate the problem and get it troubleshooted. For mty UI term 3/21-12/31 I have only been payed for the first two weeks on June 19th, and NOTHING since. I am owed over 12 thousand dollars in back UI. Please help me. I am desperate.
