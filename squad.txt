you go big i go bigger
pull up these niggas go tigga
tryna get my spot go figure
but i been that nigga
even before my figures
been livin on hairline triggers
tired of 12 pullin they triggers
when they could just talk to us niggas
why they never wanna talk to us nigga?
remember 12 pulled up on me, i was cornered
and these niggas near smoked me
flung me round the back seat like it was nothing
rolling through the heart of my city
back of the squad it hit me
